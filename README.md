## Weather App

This is a web application that fetches real-time weather data from an API and displays it to the user. Users can search for the weather in different locations and view hourly, daily, and weekly forecasts.

### Features

-   Fetches real-time weather data from an API
-   Allows users to search for weather in different locations
-   Displays hourly, daily, and weekly forecasts
-   Provides detailed weather information, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more
-   Responsive design that looks great on desktop and mobile devices
-   Styled with Tailwind CSS

### Technologies used

-   React JS
-   Tailwind CSS for styling
-   OpenWeatherMap API for weather data

### Why I created this project

I built this project to practice my skills in React JS and API integration. Weather apps are a great way to learn how to work with APIs and handle real-time data. I also wanted to create a useful tool that people could use to check the weather in their area, while getting familiar with Tailwind CSS.

### How to run the app

To run this app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository
2.  Install the dependencies by running `npm install`
3.  Get an API key from OpenWeatherMap and set it as an environment variable called `REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY`
4.  Start the development server with `npm start`

That's it! You should now be able to view the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
